# Privacy Policy for Fast PDF Maker : Photo to PDF

**Last updated:** 28 Feb 2026

The Fast PDF Maker app was developed by Harjinder Singh. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the developer will be referred to as "we," "us," or "our." We provide this app as a free, ad-supported service, and it is intended for use 'as is'.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

## 1. Offline Processing (Zero-Server Policy)
We prioritize your privacy. Fast PDF Maker operates entirely offline. The images you select, the photos you take with your camera, and the PDF documents you generate are processed locally on your device. We do not upload, store, or transmit your files, images, or documents to any external servers or third-party databases.

## 2. Information Collection and Use
For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to grant the app certain permissions. The information that we request will be retained on your device and is not collected by us in any way.

The app requires the following device permissions:
* **Camera:** To allow you to take photos directly within the app for document conversion.
* **Storage / Photo Gallery (Read/Write):** To allow you to select existing images from your gallery and to save the generated PDF documents to your device.

## 3. Third-Party Services and Advertising
While we do not collect personal data directly, the app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you, primarily for serving advertisements and powering app features.

* **Google AdMob:** We use AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect and use data such as your device’s advertising ID, IP address, and usage data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.
* **Google ML Kit (Document Scanner):** We use Google ML Kit via Google Play Services to power the Smart Document Scanner. While all document scanning and image cropping happens entirely **offline on your device**, the Google SDK may collect basic diagnostic, performance, and usage data to ensure the scanner functions correctly.

## 4. Security
We value your trust in providing us your information. Because all document processing happens locally on your mobile device, the security of your documents relies entirely on the security of your device itself. We do not have access to your files.

## 5. Links to Other Sites
This Service may contain advertisements that link to other sites. If you click on a third-party ad link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information (such as through third-party ad tracking), please contact us.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
